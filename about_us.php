      <p>Overview</p>
      <p>  After delivering many advances in software products aimed at designing in 3D and managing the resultant products across their lives, we believe there is a new world to imagine, create and build by leveraging science, engineering and art and by taking advantage of the significant technological advances to reduce the distance between the Virtual World and the Real World. This led us, in 2012 to define our new Horizon which we call 3DEXPERIENCE with the mission to provide business and people with 3DEXPERIENCE universes to imagine sustainable innovations capable of harmonizing product, nature and life. Our software portfolio spans a wide spectrum of domains from modelling and scientific simulation to manufacturing production and logistics optimization, and is applicable from Natural Resources to Cities, Transportation, Buildings, Smart Products, Consumer Goods, all the way to biological systems, chemistry and material sciences.
